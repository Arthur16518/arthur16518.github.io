# About me

At the moment I am a 4th-year student of Minsk Radioengineering College where I get a programmer education. During my studies, I managed to try a lot of technologies. I have been making such things as
- desktop applications (*Windows Forms*, *WPF*)
- back-end for websites (*ASP.NET Core MVC*, *PHP*)
- databases (*Entity Framework* + *MS SQL*, *MySQL*)
- client-side for websites (*HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* with libraries *jQuery* and *SVG.js*)
- mobile games (*Unity*)

My friends and acquaintances often highlight such my qualities as:
 - **Creativity.** Often I can come up with and create something non-standard and unusual that other people might like. 
 - **Perseverance.** I am able to sit at work for a long time, without stopping, to be patient in many classes. 
 - **Responsibility.** I always take my work seriously, especially when people rely on me.

I think to myself that I am a perfectionist. I can spend a lot of time bringing everything to perfection. The feeling that I did everything perfectly raises my mood and calms me down.

# Interests

- **Programming.** I chose the profession of a programmer. I was always impressed by how the text with the code turned into a real program that solves different problems.
- **Computer graphics.** I like to create on the computer any things that require creativity, especially related to graphics and UI design.
- **Videogames**
