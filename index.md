## About me

Some text about me.

## Interests

- **Programming.** I chose the profession of a programmer. I was always impressed by how the text with the code turned into a real program that solves different problems.
- **Photography.** Photography is my favorite art form. I love taking pictures. The photo can convey any mood and move to any place.
- **Computer graphics.** I like to create any things on the computer that require creativity.
