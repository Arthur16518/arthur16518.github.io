# About me

At the moment I am a 4th-year student of Minsk Radioengineering College where I get a programmer education. I have a good command of technologies such as HTML and CSS, Delphi and also the basics of JavaScript and C#. I have good skills in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Dreamweaver, CorelDraw and AutoCad LT.

My friends and acquaintances often highlight such my qualities as:
 - **Creativity.** Often I can come up with and create something non-standard and unusual that other people might like. 
 - **Perseverance.** I am able to sit at work for a long time, without stopping, to be patient in many classes. 
 - **Responsibility.** I always take my work seriously, especially when people rely on me.

I think to myself that I am a perfectionist. I can spend a lot of time bringing everything to perfection. The feeling that I did everything perfectly raises my mood and calms me down.

# Interests

- **Programming.** I chose the profession of a programmer. I was always impressed by how the text with the code turned into a real program that solves different problems.
- **Computer graphics.** I like to create on the computer any things that require creativity, especially related to graphics and UI design.
- **Videogames**
